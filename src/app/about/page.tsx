            <p className="mb-6">Hey! I’m Andrés Vega, Fullstack Developer with years of experience building websites that not only look good, but work flawlessly behind the scenes too.</p>

            <p className="mb-6">I’ve worked with agencies in the <strong>US</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong>, helping them bring digital ideas to life, solve real problems, and launch fast, flexible websites. I love clean design, smooth user experiences, and tackling both the front and back end of the web.</p>

            <p className="mb-6">When I’m not coding, I’m probably <strong>writing about the web or testing out new ideas just for fun.</strong></p>
